# Fantasy_Cricket-
It is an online game where you create a virtual team of real cricket players and score points
depending on how your chosen players perform in real life matches. To win a tournament,
you must try and get the maximum points and the No. 1 rank amongst other participants.
Here's how a Fantasy Cricket game may look like.
